This project is a basic E-commerce website. I used HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the front-end, and Node.js with MongoDB for the back-end. The website lets users browse products, view details, add items to a cart, and manage their orders.

Technologies Used

HTML & CSS: For the web page layout and design.

JavaScript: To add interactive features.

Node.js: Handles the server-side logic.

MongoDB: Stores product and order data.

Important Note

The node_modules folder, which contains many files for Node.js dependencies, is not included in this repository because it’s too large. If you need to run this project, you’ll have to install the necessary dependencies using the npm install command after cloning the repository.
